SenchaArchitect-GridTooltips
============================

GridTooltips extension for Sencha Architect 3.1 and Ext JS 5.0.1

To use this extension, please clone into `<project>/packages/GridTooltips`.

I've developed a method to produce Architect extensions which I hope will simplify the process.

If any changes are made to the source then simple execute `compile.sh` after those changes have been completed. This will re-compile the source so that it can be used by Architect.

Changes to the definition file(s) should continue to be performed as instructed on Sencha's website.
